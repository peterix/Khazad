/*****************************\

Recomended IDE: CodeBlocks the free crossplatform IDE

Recommended Compiler: GCC

Download both from this link 

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/codeblocks/codeblocks-8.02mingw-setup.exe

Settings:

Under Settings -> Global compiler settings -> Linker settings -> Other linker options: 	 

Add the following: 	 
	-lmingw32 	 
	-lSDLmain 	 
	-lSDL
	
All Build options create Khazad.exe and will overwrite each other, all DLL's are provided and Khazad will run without any additional dependencies.

You should get these dependencies first:
  sdl + friends (just go into the package manager and install everything that looks like it belongs to sdl)
  libgl (mesa+libgl or working proprietary 3d drivers)
  freeglut
  guichan
  zlib/libz
  codeblocks (for building it)
You'll also need the -dev packages for all this with the exception of codeblocks if you use a distro that separates them. 

check out the code from subversion:
svn co https://khazad.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/khazad/Khazad/trunk khazad 

Now you can build it using codeblocks from the command line:
  codeblocks --build Projects/Linux/CodeBlocks/Khazad.cbp
Or open the project file in the codeblocks GUI and build it from there.

If all goes well, you'll have a Khazad binary that you can run in the current folder.
