Change Log for Khazad

- V 0.0.6 (SVN 321) Map extraction is now done through DFHack as an included library, it supports 40d, 40d9, 40d11, 40d12, 40d13, 40d14, 40d15 and 40d16 both windows and linux.  New interface components added, multi-control point Slider makes controlling the slicing planes much easier, new Dig menu with Dig, Ramp and Channel replace key commands for these functions.  Vertical lock mode changed to a general 'lock-angle' mode, when activated the camera will not tilt from mouse movement.  Directional keys and NumPad now slide the camera in the XY plane.  New toggle buttons allow/disallow drawing of areas based on the Subterranean, Sunlit and Outside flags.  Textures for different surface types of materials combine to make rough, smooth and constructed surfaces look different based on XML data.  All stone and metals now listed in XML files and accessible to modification.  Tree and building models supported though performance is poor when many are rendered, also most lack model files and aren't rendered.  Memory efficiency and map dump speed greatly increased due to redesign of map structure.  Saving and Loading of maps disabled while format is in flux.

- V 0.0.5 (SVN 084) Support for 40d12 and Linux build compatability added.  Two new User Interface panels added, one which controls memory dumping, loading and saving and exiting the program, the key options for these actions have been removed.  The second panel controls the Camera, both can be dragged around at will.  A vertical depth slider on the right hand side of the screen moves the viewing slice up and down.  Tilting and Orbiting of the Camera is now activated by pressing (but not scrolling) the middle mouse wheel, zooming is still done by scrollng the wheel.  Left mouse click now moves the selection cube and selecting works on multiple levels.  Scrolling with the mouse at screen edge dropped.  Compressed Map files are now orders of magnitude smaller.  Fonts and their sizes can now be specified in XML, the first font listed will be used.  Tiles can be 'dug out' by pressing (d) but the changes are not saved in any way.

- V 0.0.4 (SVN 036) Splash Screen bug fixed attempted again, None-natural water and lava will now be displayed such as undergournd cistersn, pools, channels, elf incinerator etc etc, slow down in shaded mode removed shadding now enabled by default, Scroll wheel can change viewing level (Wheel + Spacebar) and slice thickness (Wheel + Shift), Exploded View option added controled with PageUp (compress) / PageDown (explode), bottom level renderind fixed, vertical rendering orientation lock added toggle with (v), Underground walls now render better for visability in vertical mode, SubTerranean, SkyView and SunLit toggles now available with (u), (i) and (o) respectivly and can be used to improve performance by rendering only a portion of the map.  Lastly the window now scrolls when the mouse is brought to the edge.

- BugFix A - fixed Constructed wall texture and upside down splash screen bug

- V 0.0.3 (SVN 025) Now compatible with 40d (but not the 40d# OpenGL builds).  Water feature rendering is greatly improved, (f) toggles a wire frame around the whole of the map to help orient perspective and a single cube at the center of the view, (s) toggles the shadding system, (h) toggles hidden features (hidden by default), textures beutified.  Speed improved. Simple splash screen with instructions and new Logo added.
