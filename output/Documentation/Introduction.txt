Greetings fellow developers and Dwarf Fortress fans, 
 
This project 'Khazad' has two primary goals, first to teach me a bunch of OpenGL and give me experience with engine creation, and second to act as a technical demonstration of UI systems for Dwarf Fortress. The 3Dwarf viewer (by sinothdither) is a key inspirational program for me but ware 3Dwarf can only read data from Dwarf Fortress Khazad will maintain its own complete and editable map and aims to be a more complete engine. Khazad will also also explore mouse based selections within its environment and in particular the tasks of accurately Designating in 3 dimensions.

Assistence is welcome, Art assets in the form of textures are needed badly and experienced programmers who want to begin creating some the incomplete sub-systems or try to test their ideas are welcome.  All code is under the GPL and art assets under variations of the Creative Commons licence.
